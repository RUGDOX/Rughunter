                with privacy as its cornerstone.
	•	Real-Time Protection: Transactions are assessed for potential risks before they are broadcast to the Rugd Chain or other blockchains, stopping scams before they 
                take place.
	•	Informed Decision-Making: Users are alerted to potential threats with clear, actionable insights, empowering them to take control of their transactions.
	•	Adaptive Intelligence: RugHunter leverages advanced technologies to stay ahead of evolving threats, learning and adapting dynamically to new scam tactics.

How RugHunter Works
	1.	Localized Monitoring: Transactions are intercepted and evaluated directly on the device, preserving complete user privacy.
	2.	Threat Data Usage: Basic threat pattern data, sanitized of personal identifiable information (PII), is encrypted and securely sent to the threat database on the 
                Rugd Chain 
                for continuous analysis and training. End-user privacy remains a key focal point for RugHunter.
